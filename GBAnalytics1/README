The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of both OLTP and OLAP databases.
Both databases are completedly created with T-SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Developer Edition 2025

In GBAnalytics1 folder
001_oltp_step1.sql
Running all of the SQL code in here creates global temp tables with various datatypes

001_oltp_step2.sql
Running this stored procedure code creates equivalent ROWSETs of the same various data types with some random-ness applied to the number of rows of this data

001_oltp_step3.sql
Running this file, creates all of the OLTP tables necessary for storing the real operational database tables

001_oltp_step4.sql
Running this file, takes the global ROWSET temp variables and stores them into the real db tables stored from step 3 file.

001_olap_step1.sql
Running this file, creates the OLAP data which can be used by reporting tools, in this case we use Power BI

8/7/25
Finalized OLAP database with Analytics Queries
Also created results tables for A/B Variant Testing and Retention/Churn/Lapse
Current version of BI reports available in the following file:  PowerBI/PowerBI_Resellers_01.pdf
