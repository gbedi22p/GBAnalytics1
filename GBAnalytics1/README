The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of both OLTP and OLAP databases.
Both databases are completedly created with T-SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Developer Edition 2025

In GBAnalytics1 folder
001_oltp_step1.sql
Running all of the SQL code in here creates global temp tables with various datatypes

001_oltp_step2.sql
Running this stored procedure code creates equivalent ROWSETs of the same various data types with some random-ness applied to the number of rows of this data

001_oltp_step3.sql
Running this file, creates all of the OLTP tables necessary for storing the real operational database tables

001_oltp_step4.sql
Running this file, takes the global ROWSET temp variables and stores them into the real db tables stored from step 3 file.

001_olap_step1.sql
Running this file, creates the OLAP data which can be used by reporting tools, in this case we use Power BI


See PowerBI/PowerBI_Resellers_01.pbix
A initial version of this PDF version of this file is avaible in the PowerBI folder:  PowerBI_Resellers_01.pdf

Next Steps will be to create a dashboard with ALL of the following
Planned BI Metrics AND also to go back to the original OLTP data and shape the data so that sensible retention curves could be created.
1.  Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
2.  Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
3.  Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)
4.  Distinct Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CustomerID])
5.  Avg Sales per Customer = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Distinct Customers], 0)
6.  Total Orders = COUNT(Sales[OrderID])
7.  Average Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders], 0)
8.  Cumulative Sales (Running Total) = CALCULATE([Total Sales], 
                                                 FILTER(
                                                     ALLSELECTED(Date[Date]),
                                                     Date[Date] <= MAX(Date[Date])
                                                     )
                                                 )
9.  Sales Last Year = CALCULATE([Total Sales], 
                                SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Date[Date]))
10.  YoY Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [Sales LY], [Sales LY], 0)
11.  Sales Previous Month = CALCULATE([Total Sales],
                                      PREVIOUSMONTH(Date[Date]))
12.  MoM Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [Sales PM], [Sales PM], 0)
13.  Sales for Selected Category
     Food Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], Sales[Category] = 'Food')
14.  Top 5 Products by Sales
     Create a calculated table:
     TopProducts =
     TOPN(5, SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[ProductName], 'TotalSales', [Total Sales]),
          [Total Sales], DESC)
15.  Customer Retention Flag
     Is Returning Customer =
     IF(CALCULATE(COUNT(Sales[OrderID]), 
        ALLEXCEPT(Sales, Sales[CustomerID])) > 1, 1, 0)
16.  % of Total Sales = DIVIDE([Total Sales], CALCULATE([Total Sales], ALL(Sales)), 0)
17.  Rank by Revenue
     Sales Rank = RANKX(ALL(Sales[ProductName]), [Total Sales], , DESC)
18.  Customer Churn %
     Churn Rate = DIVIDE([Lost Customers], [Total Customers Last Month], 0)
19.  Time to First Purchase
     First Purchase Date = CALCULATE(MIN(Sales[OrderDate]),
                                     ALLEXCEPT(Sales, Sales[CustomerID])
                                    ) 
20.  IF + SWITCH for KPI Color Logic
     KPI Status =
     SWITCH(
            TRUE(),
            [Total Sales] >= 1000000, 'Green',
            [Total Sales] >= 5000000, 'Yellow',
            'Red')
